    <description>Ever gotten to the end of greed mode, and wanted to donate all your coins easily? Well, now you can. The Donation Machine and Greed Donation Machine are both supported.

Simply hold the drop button when you first walk into the machine, and all your coins will be donated. You can only fill the machine up to 999 coins using this method. You'll have to tap the machine one more time if you want to put in 1000 and watch it explode.

This behavior is limited to regular players. So, no co-op babies or Strawmen.

As a bonus, Mod Config Menu will let you toggle donation machine state, fix broken machines, and even automatically unjam machines using newer Repentogon methods that won't slow you down in the middle of donating.

All of the automation here requires Repentogon. The MCM toggles are available to the Vanilla API.</description>
